I learned  Lang Graph limitations as well as how it make it useful.                                                                                          
Then the difference between chain and agent architecture where chains follow fixed steps and agents can decide their own.
Then we see how LangGraph balances control and reliability, while also allowing persistence, streaming, and human involvement in workflows.
