## Module 1 

### Video 1 : 

**Learnings :** 

I learned  Lang Graph limitations as well as how it make it useful.                                                                                          
Then the difference between chain and agent architecture where chains follow fixed steps and agents can decide their own.
Then we see how LangGraph balances control and reliability, while also allowing persistence, streaming, and human involvement in workflows.

### Video 2 :

What I learned: 

In this part, I learned how to build a basic graph that makes a decision. The exercise involved using a simple dictionary input and a single condition to form a sentence.built the graph, visualized it to see the logic, and then tested it to make sure it worked as expected.

Tweaks I made:

I expanded the graph from three to five nodes, each representing a different mood or outcome.
I updated the conditional edge logic so that after the first node, the graph randomly chooses one of four possible end nodes.
I adjusted the markdown and code to match the new structure, making sure the documentation and outputs reflect the five-node setup.

### Video 3 :

The graph that is done in Video 2, we did it same but on studio this time, 
but to do it on studio i have made changes in .py file also the same change done in video2.
